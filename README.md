# Credit Scoring Business Understanding

## Overview
Credit scoring is the process of assigning a quantitative measure to a potential borrower to estimate the likelihood of default. This project focuses on developing a credit scoring model for **Bati Bank**, enabling a "Buy-Now-Pay-Later" service in partnership with an eCommerce company. The model transforms customer behavioral data into a predictive risk score to inform loan approvals and terms.

## Key Questions and Explanations

### 1. Basel II Accord’s Influence on Model Requirements
The Basel II Capital Accord emphasizes **risk measurement** as a core aspect of financial stability. This has significant implications for the credit scoring model:

- **Regulatory Compliance**: Basel II mandates that banks align their capital reserves with measured credit risks. Therefore, models must be interpretable and well-documented to ensure transparency and adherence to regulations.
- **Stakeholder Trust**: Auditors, regulators, and internal stakeholders need to understand and trust the model’s outcomes. A lack of interpretability can lead to non-compliance, legal issues, and reputational risks.

#### Why Interpretable Models Matter:
An interpretable model, such as logistic regression with Weight-of-Evidence (WoE), provides clear, variable-level insights into the decision-making process. This aligns with Basel II’s requirements for transparency and traceability.

### 2. Necessity of a Proxy Variable for Default
In the absence of direct "default" labels, creating a proxy variable is essential:

- **Why a Proxy is Needed**: Early-stage credit data lacks historical information on actual defaults, especially for new borrowers. A proxy variable acts as a stand-in, using measurable behaviors (e.g., delayed payments) to indicate credit risk.
- **Defining a Proxy**: Examples include:
  - ">30 days late" on a payment.
  - "Three consecutive missed payments."

#### Risks of Proxy Variables:
- **Misrepresentation**: Proxies may not fully capture true default behavior, leading to inaccurate predictions.
- **Business Impact**: Poorly chosen proxies can result in adverse selection, where risky customers are approved, or creditworthy customers are rejected.

#### Mitigation Strategies:
- Validate the proxy against historical data.
- Continuously refine the proxy as more actual defaults are observed.

### 3. Trade-offs: Simple vs. Complex Models
In regulated environments like banking, selecting the right model involves balancing interpretability, performance, and compliance.

#### Comparison:
| Factor                 | **Simple Models** <br>(e.g., Logistic Regression + WoE) | **Complex Models** <br>(e.g., Gradient Boosting) |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Interpretability**   | High; easy to explain variable contributions              | Low; decisions are harder to interpret          |
| **Regulatory Approval**| Easier to justify                                         | Requires additional explainability tools        |
| **Performance**        | Moderate; may miss non-linear patterns                   | High; captures complex interactions            |
| **Documentation**      | Straightforward                                          | Requires extensive efforts                      |
| **Maintenance**        | Simple to update                                         | Resource-intensive                              |
| **Risk**               | Lower; easier governance                                 | Higher; opaque decision-making                 |

#### Recommendations:
1. **Baseline Model**: Start with a logistic regression model, enhanced with Weight-of-Evidence (WoE), to satisfy Basel II requirements for interpretability and compliance.
2. **Advanced Models**: Experiment with gradient boosting or similar methods. Deploy only if performance gains justify the additional complexity and governance requirements.
3. **Explainability Tools**: Use SHAP or LIME for complex models to provide insights into decision-making.

## Project Objectives
1. **Define a Proxy Variable**:
   - Categorize users as high-risk (bad) or low-risk (good).
   - Ensure the proxy reflects realistic default behavior.
2. **Feature Selection**:
   - Identify observable features that correlate strongly with the default variable (e.g., Recency, Frequency, Monetary patterns).
3. **Develop Models**:
   - Assign risk probabilities for new customers.
   - Assign credit scores based on risk probabilities.
   - Predict optimal loan amounts and durations.

## Conclusion
The credit scoring model must balance regulatory compliance, interpretability, and predictive performance. By starting with interpretable models and cautiously exploring advanced techniques, Bati Bank can ensure robust, compliant, and effective credit risk management.
